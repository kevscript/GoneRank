## What is Gonerank

Gonerank is a performance rating plateform for Lyon's football team. In between matches, fans have the opportunity to submit and share their ratings for the latest match.

Those evaluations are computed into readable statistics, that can be used to track the progress of the team and players, as well as allow users to compare their ratings with the rest of the community.

The application is managed through a fully fledged Admin dashboard.
